# Arch Linux and DWM configuration - by hav4ik

This repository contains my configuration of Arch Linux, some useful patches, fonts, and some command line tools. In summary, the following software and tools are installed and configured:
* [dwm][dwm]: a tiny and very powerful tiling window manager with optional [configuration][dwm-config]
* [vim][vim]: a powerful text editor that I use as my primary C/C++ IDE, see my [configurations][vim-config]
* [rxvt-unicode][urxvt]: a highly customizable terminal emulator, see my [configurations][urxvt-config]
* [conky][conky]: a lightweight and highly configurable system monitor, see my [configurations][conky-config]
* [feh][feh]: lightweight image viewer, used to set background wallpaper
* [offlineimap][offlineimap]: a python utility to sync mail from IMAP, you can run in background and synchronize multiple accounts (yahoo mail & gmail in my case) with this [configuration][offlineimap-config]
* [mutt][mutt]: a very powerful text-based mail client, it can be used with offlineimap

External plugins and resources that are used but not included in repository:
* [vim-airline][vim-airline]: a lean & mean status/tabline plugin for vim
* [vim-fugitive][vim-fugitive]: a git wrapper for vim
* [NERDTree][nerdtree]: a filesystem tree explorer for vim
* [clang_complete][clang-complete]: this plugin uses clang (you must have libclang installed on your system) for accurately complete C and C++ code in vimi.

Other stuffs that ROCKS:
* [dwb][dwb]: a lightweight web browser, it's fully usable even without the mouse
* [wicd-curses][wicd-curses]: a powerful network manager with compact and user-friendly ncurses interface
* [connman][connman]: a powerful network manager with great cli interface
* [ncmpcpp][ncmpcpp]: an [mpd][mpd] client with a great user interface and rich features
